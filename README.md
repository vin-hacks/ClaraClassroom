# Clara S. Traversal's Classroom

The Clara S. Traversal's Classroom web security challenge is a challenge where you will need to exploit a couple of web vulnerabilities in order to make Vincent's final grade over 90%.

- Objective : Gain access to the class and find a way to change the user Vincent's final grade to be over 90%

- Requirements : Python installed.

Startup 

clone repo
```
cd classroom
python3 server.py
```

In another shell
```
cd classroom
python3 teacher.py

Then you should be able to access http://localhost:8081/ in your browser and begin hacking!
